# Climate Trends and Crop Yield Analysis
## Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between climate trends and crop yields across major agricultural countries over some time. By analyzing temperature, rainfall, and agricultural output data, the project aims to uncover patterns and correlations that can inform better decision-making in agricultural and environmental planning.

## Features
* **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handles raw climate and agricultural data, ensuring consistency and accuracy for analysis.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Uses statistical and graphical techniques to identify trends and outliers in the data.
* **Statistical Analysis:** Applies regression and correlation analysis to evaluate the impact of climate variables on crop yields.
* **Data Visualization:** Produces clear and insightful visualizations to communicate findings effectively.

## Technologies Used
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**
⋅⋅⋅ **Pandas** used for data manipulation
⋅⋅⋅ **Matplotlib** for data visualization

## Dataset
The project used publicly available datasets containing:
* Global Crop Yield - https://ourworldindata.org/crop-yields
* Global Temperature Anomalies - https://ourworldindata.org/temperature-anomaly

## Results
Key findings of the analysis can be found in the notebook ```analysis.ipynb```.
